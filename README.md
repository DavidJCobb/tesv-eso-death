# ESO Death and Resurrection
A mod for Skyrim Classic. Download it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/92853).

In vanilla Skyrim, dying forces you to sit around on your butt waiting for your last save to load up. It's boring and uninteresting, and to the extent that it "punishes" player death (by wasting all the time you spent since your last save), that punishment is tedious and unimaginative.

This mod implements Elder Scrolls Online-style death in Skyrim. When you're killed, you'll turn into a ghost for about fifteen seconds. In that state, you can't interact with NPCs, locked doors, harvestable flora, containers, or items, and you can't fight. It's an opportunity to retreat from whatever situation you were unprepared for.

SKSE's H and CPP files (for the "skse" and "common" projects) are not included on this repo. Get them from the SKSE source, and mind the licensing on them!

I place no restrictions on the usage of any content in the "SKSE Plugin/ESODeath/ReverseEngineered" folder. All content inside describes data structures, subroutine addresses, and similar found in the 2011 release of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I can't and don't claim ownership over it; I merely documented existing sysetms. Everything *outside* of that folder, however, should be considered source-available but not open-source/open-license.
