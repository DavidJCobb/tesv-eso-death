# ESO Death and Resurrection
A mod for Skyrim Classic. Download it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/92853).

In vanilla Skyrim, dying forces you to sit around on your butt waiting for your last save to load up. It's boring and uninteresting, and to the extent that it "punishes" player death (by wasting all the time you spent since your last save), that punishment is tedious and unimaginative.

This mod implements Elder Scrolls Online-style death in Skyrim. When you're killed, you'll turn into a ghost for about fifteen seconds. In that state, you can't interact with NPCs, locked doors, harvestable flora, containers, or items, and you can't fight. It's an opportunity to retreat from whatever situation you were unprepared for.
